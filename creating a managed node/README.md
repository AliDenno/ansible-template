# Managed Node Installation

### Installation steps:

1. Setup an instance (aws-ec2, vps, etc.)
   - if you got an error "key too open" when connection, do the following: 
   ```sh
    chmod 400 Key
   ```

2. Setup hostname
   - be root
   ```sh
    sudo su -
   ```
   - change it in the hostname file
   ```sh
    vi /etc/hostname
   ```
   - also 
   ```sh
    hostname instance-managed-node
   ```
3. Create ansadmin user [use the same one accross environments]
   - create user ansadmin
   ```sh
     adduser ansadmin
     passwd ansadmin
   ```
4. Add user to sudoers file
   ```sh
      visudo
   ```
   - add ansadmin
   ```sh
      ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```
5. Enable password based login (Temporaly)
   ```sh
      vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   - set the following:
   ```sh
      PasswordAuthentication yes
   ```
   - restart the service:
   ```sh
      reload sshd.service
   ```
6. Creating the communication between the control node and managed nodes:
   - grab the managed node ip:
   ```sh
      ip addr
   ```
   then add it to the 'hosts' file of the control node (using the ansible user), usually:
   ```sh
      /opt/ansible/hosts 
   ```
   - copy the public key from the control node to the managed nodes to obtain ansible access (that is why PasswordAuthentication is set to yes temporarily), on control node do the following:
   ```sh
      ssh-copy-id control-node-ip
   ```
